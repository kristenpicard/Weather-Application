## Description 

In this project I created a Weather Application.

Features of the scheduler:

When the user searches the name of a city, the current weather of that city is displayed along with the forecast of the upcoming 5 days in that city.

Additionally, when the user searches the name of a city that city is stored in a button below the search field.

This allows the user to click on cities they have already searched and displays the cooresponding current and 5-day forecast from that city.

This screenshot shows the page when it loads:
